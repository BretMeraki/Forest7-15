# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Forest System test suite is currently at 86.1% passing (31/36 tests), with 5 failing tests across three critical modules. This feature aims to fix all failing tests to achieve 100% test suite passing rate, ensuring production readiness and system reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix GatedOnboarding Module Failures

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the GatedOnboarding system to pass all tests, so that the 6-stage onboarding flow works reliably for users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the gated onboarding system is initialized THEN it SHALL properly initialize all required dependencies
2. WHEN Stage 1 (goal capture) is executed THEN the system SHALL return proper validation results with all required properties
3. WHEN Stage 2 (context gathering) is executed THEN the system SHALL return context summary with proper structure
4. WHEN Stage 3 (dynamic questionnaire) is executed THEN the system SHALL return questions array with proper question objects
5. WHEN Stage 4 (complexity analysis) is executed THEN the system SHALL return complexity analysis with score and level properties
6. WHEN Stage 5 (HTA generation) is executed THEN the system SHALL return HTA tree with proper depth and node structure
7. WHEN Stage 6 (task generation) is executed THEN the system SHALL return tasks array with comprehensive validation

### Requirement 2: Fix NextPipelinePresenter Module Failures

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the NextPipelinePresenter to pass all tests, so that the hybrid pipeline presentation works correctly for users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pipeline generation is requested THEN the system SHALL return tasks array with proper task objects
2. WHEN pipeline generation is requested THEN each task SHALL have required properties (id, title, description, duration, type, energyLevel)
3. WHEN pipeline generation is requested THEN the system SHALL respect time and energy constraints
4. WHEN pipeline generation is requested THEN the system SHALL return proper presentation type and metadata
5. WHEN pipeline task variety is requested THEN the system SHALL provide balanced task distribution
6. WHEN pipeline generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error handling

### Requirement 3: Fix HTAIntelligence Module Failures

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the HTAIntelligence system to pass all tests, so that hierarchical task analysis works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dynamic branch generation is requested THEN the system SHALL generate 3-8 relevant branches without generic names
2. WHEN 6-level hierarchical decomposition is requested THEN the system SHALL generate tree with proper depth (4-6 levels)
3. WHEN HTA tree is generated THEN it SHALL have proper node count (15-500 nodes) and structure validation
4. WHEN goal complexity analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL return complexity score and analysis
5. WHEN schema-driven HTA generation is requested THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing HTA systems

### Requirement 4: Ensure Test Suite Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test suite to be reliable and comprehensive, so that I can trust the system quality metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all tests are run THEN the success rate SHALL be 100% (36/36 tests passing)
2. WHEN tests are run multiple times THEN the results SHALL be consistent and reproducible
3. WHEN test failures occur THEN they SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information
4. WHEN new features are added THEN existing tests SHALL continue to pass (regression prevention)

### Requirement 5: Maintain System Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all system components to work together seamlessly, so that the overall Forest System remains functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixes are applied THEN existing functionality SHALL remain intact
2. WHEN modules are updated THEN their integration points SHALL continue to work properly
3. WHEN test fixes are implemented THEN they SHALL not break production code paths
4. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL be ready for production deployment
