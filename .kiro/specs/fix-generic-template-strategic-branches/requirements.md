# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Forest learning system has a sophisticated architecture where user context from onboarding should snowball through the HTA tree generation process, creating a massive vectorized tree with increasingly specific branches and tasks. Currently, there's a critical break in this context flow - the system falls back to generic hardcoded templates instead of leveraging the accumulated user context to generate truly personalized strategic branches. This results in poor user experience with generic phases like "Foundation Phase" instead of contextually rich branches that evolve and become more targeted as the user progresses through their learning journey.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a learner using the Forest system, I want my onboarding context to flow seamlessly into HTA tree generation, so that my strategic branches become increasingly personalized and targeted as I progress through my learning journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes onboarding with specific context THEN the system SHALL pass this context to HTA tree generation
2. WHEN HTA tree generation occurs THEN it SHALL use accumulated user context to create personalized strategic branches
3. WHEN strategic branches are initially created THEN they SHALL be contextually relevant but allow for progressive refinement
4. WHEN the user completes tasks THEN the system SHALL use completion context to make subsequent branches more targeted and specific

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Forest system, I want the context snowball effect to work properly through the entire pipeline, so that generic templates are never used when rich user context is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN onboarding context is collected THEN it SHALL be properly stored and vectorized for HTA generation
2. WHEN HTA generation requests strategic branches THEN the LLM SHALL receive the full accumulated context
3. WHEN branches are generated THEN they SHALL leverage user context rather than falling back to hardcoded templates
4. WHEN task completion provides new context THEN it SHALL be integrated into the vectorized tree for future branch refinement

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the vectorized tree to contain rich metadata that enables progressive personalization, so that branches become more targeted as users advance through their learning path.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the HTA tree is generated THEN it SHALL create a massive vectorized structure with metadata-rich nodes
2. WHEN branches are initially invisible to users THEN they SHALL contain informative metadata and indicators
3. WHEN users complete tasks THEN the system SHALL use stored context to refine upcoming branches before they become visible
4. WHEN branches become active THEN they SHALL feel perfectly targeted due to accumulated context refinement

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a learner, I want each recommended task to feel perfectly suited to my goals and progress, so that my learning experience feels seamless and personalized throughout my journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I receive task recommendations THEN they SHALL feel perfectly targeted to my specific goal and current progress
2. WHEN I complete tasks THEN the system SHALL use my completion patterns to refine future recommendations
3. WHEN I progress through branches THEN they SHALL become increasingly specific and relevant to my learning style
4. WHEN I reach advanced stages THEN the tasks SHALL reflect deep personalization based on my accumulated learning context
