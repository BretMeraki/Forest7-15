### Available Commands

#### Core Reset Operations

```bash
# Full system factory reset (all projects)
factory_reset_forest
  --confirm "I understand this will permanently delete all Forest projects and data"

# Single project reset
factory_reset_forest
  --project_id "my_project_123"
  --confirm "I want to permanently delete the project 'my_project_123' and all its data"

# Quick reset (bypass confirmation - use with extreme caution)
factory_reset_forest
  --project_id "test_project"
  --force_confirm true
```

#### Preview and Safety Commands

```bash
# Preview what would be deleted (recommended before reset)
get_factory_reset_preview_forest
  --project_id "my_project_123"  # Optional: omit for full system preview

# Get confirmation dialog for review
get_factory_reset_confirmation_forest
  --project_id "my_project_123"  # Optional: omit for full system confirmation
```
