# Test Failure Analysis Report

## Overview
Current test suite status: **86.1% passing (31/36 tests)** with **5 failing tests** across three critical modules.

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### 1. GatedOnboarding Module Failures (2/6 tests failing - 66.7% success)

#### Test 5 Failure: Stage 5 - HTA tree generation
**Error**: `Tree should have a goal`
**Location**: `test-gated-onboarding-focused.js:231:7`
**Root Cause**: The HTA tree structure returned by `generateHTATree()` does not have the expected `goal` property at the root level.

**Expected vs Actual**:
- **Expected**: `tree.goal` should exist and be a string
- **Actual**: The tree object exists but lacks the `goal` property
- **Current Structure**: Tree has `branches`, `tasks`, `depth`, `totalNodes` but missing `goal`

**Specific Assertion Failing**:
```javascript
assert(tree.goal !== undefined, 'Tree should have a goal');
```

**Data Analysis**: The test shows the tree structure contains:
- `htaTree.goal`: "Learn photography" ✓ (exists in htaTree)
- `tree.goal`: undefined ❌ (missing in tree object)

The issue is that the test expects `result.tree.goal` but the actual structure has the goal in `result.htaTree.goal`.

#### Test 6 Failure: Stage 6 - Task generation (implied)
**Status**: Not explicitly shown in output but mentioned in requirements as failing
**Expected Issue**: Task generation with comprehensive validation likely fails due to missing task properties or insufficient task count.

### 2. NextPipelinePresenter Module Failures (2/3 tests failing - 33.3% success)

#### Current Status: Tests are PASSING in focused test
**Unexpected Result**: The focused test shows both tests passing, but the requirements indicate 2/3 tests are failing.

**Possible Issues**:
1. **Test Environment Difference**: The focused test may not match the actual test suite conditions
2. **Missing Assertions**: The actual test suite may have more stringent requirements
3. **Integration Issues**: The module may fail when integrated with other components

**Observed Warnings**:
- `GoalFocusedTaskSelector] Goal-focused task batch selection failed: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'recommendations')`
- This suggests the task selection logic has null reference issues

**Expected Failures Based on Requirements**:
1. **Task Generation**: Tasks missing required properties (id, title, description, duration, type, energyLevel)
2. **Pipeline Structure**: Missing proper presentation type and metadata validation

### 3. HTAIntelligence Module Failures (1/4 tests failing - 75% success)

#### Test 2 Failure: 6-level hierarchical task decomposition
**Error**: `Should have tree property`
**Root Cause**: The `buildHTATree()` method fails with "No active project found" error

**Expected vs Actual**:
- **Expected**: `result.tree` or `result.htaTree` should exist
- **Actual**: Method throws error before returning tree structure
- **Error Message**: "No active project found. Please create a project first."

**Specific Issue**: The test doesn't create a project before calling `buildHTATree()`, causing the method to fail at the project validation step.

## Root Cause Summary

### 1. Data Structure Inconsistencies
- **GatedOnboarding**: Tree structure has `goal` in `htaTree` but test expects it in `tree`
- **HTAIntelligence**: Missing project context causes tree generation to fail

### 2. Missing Dependencies
- **HTAIntelligence**: Requires active project but test doesn't create one
- **NextPipelinePresenter**: Task selector has null reference issues

### 3. Property Mapping Issues
- **GatedOnboarding**: Inconsistent property names between implementation and test expectations
- **NextPipelinePresenter**: Potential missing task properties in actual vs focused test

## Expected vs Actual Values

### GatedOnboarding Stage 5
```javascript
// Expected
result.tree.goal = "Learn photography"

// Actual  
result.tree.goal = undefined
result.htaTree.goal = "Learn photography" // Goal exists but in wrong location
```

### HTAIntelligence Test 2
```javascript
// Expected
result.tree = { goal: "Master data science...", branches: [...], depth: 4-6 }

// Actual
Error: "No active project found. Please create a project first."
```

### NextPipelinePresenter (Inferred)
```javascript
// Expected (based on requirements)
pipeline.tasks[0] = {
  id: "string",
  title: "string", 
  description: "string",
  duration: number,
  type: "string",
  energyLevel: number
}

// Actual (likely missing some properties)
// Warning: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'recommendations')"
```

## Baseline Understanding

### What Needs to be Fixed:

1. **GatedOnboarding Module**:
   - Fix tree structure property mapping (`tree.goal` vs `htaTree.goal`)
   - Ensure all 6 stages return consistent response format
   - Add proper task generation with required properties

2. **NextPipelinePresenter Module**:
   - Fix null reference in GoalFocusedTaskSelector
   - Ensure tasks have all required properties (id, title, description, duration, type, energyLevel)
   - Add proper pipeline structure validation and metadata

3. **HTAIntelligence Module**:
   - Fix project dependency requirement in buildHTATree method
   - Ensure proper project context is available or create fallback
   - Maintain tree generation with proper depth (4-6 levels) and node count (15-500)

### Success Criteria:
- **GatedOnboarding**: 6/6 tests passing (100%)
- **NextPipelinePresenter**: 3/3 tests passing (100%) 
- **HTAIntelligence**: 4/4 tests passing (100%)
- **Overall**: 36/36 tests passing (100%)
